Credit Risk Assessment using Federated Learning

<b> Motivation </b> <br/>
The lending institutions are at a constant risk from defaulting customers. Although, various subjective and quantitative factors are used to assess credit risks including AI models, the reliability of the assessment would increase multifold by using aggregated data from financial institutions. In order to mitigate the risk of breach of sensitive data in this case, we have developed a POC of credit risk assessment model that uses data from various financial institutions, without the need for centralisation of data. The accuracy of this model is comparable to the model trained with aggregated data (assuming same hyperparameters).
